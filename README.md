# Linear-Kernel-for-Proximal-Support-Vector-Regression
Creating a linear kernel code for a Proximal Support Vector Regression Problem for a concrete data set. Importing all the libraries we need. First read the data excel file using "pd.read_excel" and check if there are any missing values if any then fill the missing values by their column means respectively. furthermore normalizing the data importing "MinMaxScaler". Separating input data X and y. Splitting the data into training and testing data set in the ratio of 8:2 respectively. Defining a function for linear kernel for a proximal support vector regression and returning 4 types of error which help us to decide the hyper-parameter values. Errors are calculated using sklearn library. For choosing the hyperparameter we use k-fold cross-validation and grid search(here I used 5-fold cross-validation). In linear kernel our hyper-parameter C is in the range (2^(-10), 2^(10)). Getting the value of C for minimum MSE error. Then apply the linear kernel for testing dataset using optimum hyperparameter C and calculating MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2 error.
